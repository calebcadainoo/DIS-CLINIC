His love for work sometimes saw him not charging anything for such work. This also sometimes was fueled by his passion to see patients comfortable irrespective of whether he is paid or not. It was during one of such home care services that he landed a strategic property which later became the first home of Doctors in Service Limited. The company initially was to focus on home care services and discussions on those were held with a few people. However, the plan of God was different. We were to move into ambulatory clinics whose mission was to provide a fast, affordable client centered and quality healthcare for the numerous middle and upper class who often are frustrated by the slow, painful process of seeking medical attention in the public system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It started with staff strength of 8 persons and locum doctors with a lot of hard work, training and retraining of staff on excellent customer care, quality service and so on. The company stuck to three main principles:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Providing fast but&nbsp;quality services</li>\r\n	<li>Providing a friendly and nice environment for patient care</li>\r\n	<li>Putting the patients&rsquo; needs first in all we do</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>We focused on aggressive awareness creation in the first 6 months by focusing on different strategies. This saw our patient to out rise steadily from an average of 5 patients per day to 30 patients per day by the end of the first year.<br />\r\nThere has been steady growth in staff, patient tout, revenue, logistics, equipment&rsquo;s and skilled human resource.<br />\r\nCurrently seeing averagely 40 patients per day after 18 months in operation and being one of the preferred healthcare destinations among the middle and upper class, the company is strategically positioned for continuous growth, better services and expansion.</p>\r\n', 'dispick.jpg', '', '2017-07-13', '', ''),

(8, '', '5062', 'World Hepatitis Day', '<p>What are the types of Hepatitis Virus, causes, prevention, etc..<br />\r\nLets read about Hepatitis B.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Hepatitis B</strong><br />\r\nHepatitis B is a serious liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). For some people, hepatitis B infection becomes chronic, meaning it lasts more than six months. Having chronic hepatitis B increases your risk of developing liver failure, liver cancer or cirrhosis &mdash; a condition that causes permanent scarring of the liver.<br />\r\nMost people infected with hepatitis B as adults recover fully, even if their signs and symptoms are severe. Infants and children are more likely to develop a chronic hepatitis B infection. A vaccine can prevent hepatitis B, but there&#39;s no cure if you have it. If you&#39;re infected, taking certain precautions can help prevent spreading HBV to others.<br />\r\nSymptom<br />\r\nSigns and symptoms of hepatitis B, ranging from mild to severe, usually appear about one to four months after you&#39;ve been infected. Signs and symptoms of hepatitis B may include:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Abdominal pain<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Dark urine<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Fever<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Joint pain<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Loss of appetite<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Nausea and vomiting<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Weakness and fatigue<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice)<br />\r\nWhen to see a doctor<br />\r\nIf you know you&#39;ve been exposed to hepatitis B, contact your doctor immediately. A preventive treatment may reduce your risk of infection if you receive the treatment within 24 hours of exposure to the virus.<br />\r\nIf you think you have signs or symptoms of hepatitis B, contact your doctor.<br />\r\nCauses<br />\r\nHepatitis B infection is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The virus is passed from person to person through blood, semen or other body fluids.<br />\r\nCommon ways HBV is transmitted include:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Sexual contact. You may become infected if you have unprotected sex with an infected partner whose blood, saliva, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Sharing of needles. HBV is easily transmitted through needles and syringes contaminated with infected blood. Sharing intravenous (IV) drug paraphernalia puts you at high risk of hepatitis B.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Accidental needle sticks. Hepatitis B is a concern for health care workers and anyone else who comes in contact with human blood.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Mother to child. Pregnant women infected with HBV can pass the virus to their babies during childbirth. However, the newborn can be vaccinated to avoid getting infected in almost all cases. Talk to your doctor about being tested for hepatitis B if you are pregnant or want to become pregnant.<br />\r\nAcute vs. chronic hepatitis B<br />\r\nHepatitis B infection may be either short-lived (acute) or long lasting (chronic).<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Acute hepatitis B infection lasts less than six months. Your immune system likely can clear acute hepatitis B from your body, and you should recover completely within a few months. Most people who acquire hepatitis B as adults have an acute infection, but it can lead to chronic infection.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Chronic hepatitis B infection lasts six months or longer. When your immune system can&#39;t fight off the acute infection, hepatitis B infection may last a lifetime, possibly leading to serious illnesses such as cirrhosis and liver cancer.<br />\r\nThe younger you are when you get hepatitis B &mdash; particularly newborns or children younger than 5 &mdash; the higher your risk the infection becoming chronic. Chronic infection may go undetected for decades until a person becomes seriously ill from liver disease.<br />\r\nRisk factors</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hepatitis B spreads through contact with blood, semen or other body fluids from an infected person. Your risk of hepatitis B infection increases if you:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Have unprotected sex with multiple sex partners or with someone who&#39;s infected with HBV<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Share needles during intravenous (IV) drug use<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Are a man who has sex with other men<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Live with someone who has a chronic HBV infection<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Are an infant born to an infected mother<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Have a job that exposes you to human blood<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Travel to regions with high infection rates of HBV, such as Africa, Central and Southeast Asia, and Eastern Europe<br />\r\nComplications<br />\r\nHaving a chronic HBV infection can lead to serious complications, such as:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). The inflammation associated with a hepatitis B infection can lead to extensive liver scarring (cirrhosis), which may impair the liver&#39;s ability to function.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Liver cancer. People with chronic hepatitis B infection have an increased risk of liver cancer.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Liver failure. Acute liver failure is a condition in which the vital functions of the liver shut down. When that occurs, a liver transplant is necessary to sustain life.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Other conditions. People with chronic hepatitis B may have kidney disease, inflammation of blood vessels or anemia.<br />\r\nPreparing for your appointment<br />\r\nYou&#39;re likely to start by seeing your family doctor or a general practitioner. However, in some cases, you may be referred immediately to a specialist. Doctors who specialize in treating hepatitis B include:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Doctors who treat digestive diseases (gastroenterologists)<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Doctors who treat liver diseases (hepatologists)<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Doctors who treat infectious diseases<br />\r\nWhat you can do<br />\r\nHere&#39;s some information to help you get ready for your appointment.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Be aware of pre-appointment restrictions. When you make the appointment, ask if there&#39;s anything you need to do in advance, such as restrict your diet.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Write down your symptoms, including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Write down key personal information, including major stresses or recent life changes.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Make a list of all medications, vitamins and supplements you take.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Consider taking a family member or friend along. Someone who accompanies you may help you remember the information you receive.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Write down questions to ask your doctor.<br />\r\nListing questions for your doctor can help you make the most of your time together. For hepatitis B infection, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;What is likely causing my symptoms or condition?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Other than the most likely cause, what are other possible causes for my symptoms or condition?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;What tests do I need?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Is my condition likely temporary or chronic?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Has the hepatitis B damaged my liver or caused other complications, such as kidney problems?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;What is the best course of action?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;What are the alternatives to the primary approach you&#39;re suggesting?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;I have other health conditions. How can I best manage them together?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Are there restrictions that I need to follow?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Should I see a specialist?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Should my family be tested for hepatitis B?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;How can I protect people around me from hepatitis B?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you&#39;re prescribing?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Are there brochures or other printed material I can have? What websites do you recommend?<br />\r\nWhat to expect from your doctor<br />\r\nYour doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions, including:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;When did your symptoms begin?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Have your symptoms been continuous or occasional?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;How severe are your symptoms?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Have you ever had a blood transfusion?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Do you inject drugs?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Have you had unprotected sex?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;How many sexual partners have you had?<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Have you been diagnosed with hepatitis?<br />\r\nTest and Diagnosis<br />\r\nIf your doctor suspects you have hepatitis B, he or she will examine you and likely order blood tests. Blood tests can determine if you have the virus in your system and whether it&#39;s acute or chronic. Your doctor might also want to remove a small sample of your liver for testing (liver biopsy) to determine whether you have liver damage. During this test, your doctor inserts a thin needle through your skin and into your liver and removes a tissue sample for laboratory analysis.<br />\r\nScreening healthy people for hepatitis B<br />\r\nDoctors sometimes test certain healthy people for hepatitis B infection because the virus can damage the liver before causing signs and symptoms. Talk to your doctor about screening for hepatitis B infection if you:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Live with someone who has hepatitis B<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Have had sex with someone who has hepatitis B<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Have a liver enzyme test with unexplained abnormal results<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Have HIV or hepatitis C<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Are an immigrant from, have parents from or have adopted children from places where hepatitis B is common, including Asia, the Pacific Islands, Africa and Eastern Europe<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Inject illegal drugs<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Are an inmate<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Are a man who has sex with men<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Receive kidney dialysis<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Take medications that suppress the immune system, such as anti-rejection medications used after an organ transplant<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Are pregnant<br />\r\nIf your doctor suspects you have hepatitis B, he or she will examine you and likely order blood tests. Blood tests can determine if you have the virus in your system and whether it&#39;s acute or chronic. Your doctor might also want to remove a small sample of your liver for testing (liver biopsy) to determine whether you have liver damage. During this test, your doctor inserts a thin needle through your skin and into your liver and removes a tissue sample for laboratory analysis.<br />\r\nScreening healthy people for hepatitis B<br />\r\nDoctors sometimes test certain healthy people for hepatitis B infection because the virus can damage the liver before causing signs and symptoms. Talk to your doctor about screening for hepatitis B infection if you:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Live with someone who has hepatitis B<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Have had sex with someone who has hepatitis B<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Have a liver enzyme test with unexplained abnormal results<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Have HIV or hepatitis C<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Are an immigrant from, have parents from or have adopted children from places where hepatitis B is common, including Asia, the Pacific Islands, Africa and Eastern Europe<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Inject illegal drugs<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Are an inmate<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Are a man who has sex with men<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Receive kidney dialysis<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Take medications that suppress the immune system, such as anti-rejection medications used after an organ transplant<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Are pregnant<br />\r\nTreatments and drugs<br />\r\nTreatment to prevent hepatitis B infection after exposure<br />\r\nIf you know you&#39;ve been exposed to the hepatitis B virus, call your doctor immediately. If you haven&#39;t been vaccinated or aren&#39;t sure whether you&#39;ve been vaccinated or whether you responded to the vaccination, receiving an injection of hepatitis B immune globulin within 12 hours of coming in contact with the virus may help protect you from developing hepatitis B. You should be vaccinated at the same time.<br />\r\nTreatment for acute hepatitis B infection<br />\r\nIf your doctor determines your hepatitis B infection is acute &mdash; meaning it is short-lived and will go away on its own &mdash; you may not need treatment. Instead, your doctor might recommend rest and adequate nutrition and fluids while your body fights the infection.<br />\r\nTreatment for chronic hepatitis B infection<br />\r\nIf you&#39;ve been diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B infection, you may have treatment to reduce the risk of liver disease and prevent you from passing the infection to others. Treatments include:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Antiviral medications. Several antiviral medications &mdash; including lamivudine (Epivir), adefovir (Hepsera), telbivudine (Tyzeka) and entecavir (Baraclude) &mdash; can help fight the virus and slow its ability to damage your liver. Talk to your doctor about which medication might be right for you.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Interferon alfa-2b (Intron A). This synthetic version of a substance produced by the body to fight infection is used mainly for young people with hepatitis B who don&#39;t want to undergo long-term treatment or who might want to get pregnant within a few years. It&#39;s given by injection. Side effects may include depression, difficulty breathing and chest tightness.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Liver transplant. If your liver has been severely damaged, a liver transplant may be an option. During a liver transplant, the surgeon removes your damaged liver and replaces it with a healthy liver. Most transplanted livers come from deceased donors, though a small number come from living donors who donate a portion of their livers.<br />\r\nOther drugs to treat hepatitis B are being developed.<br />\r\nLifestyle and home remedies<br />\r\nIf you&#39;ve been infected with hepatitis B, take steps to protect others from the virus.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Make sex safer. If you&#39;re sexually active, tell your partner you have HBV and talk about the risk of transmitting it to him or her. Use a new latex condom every time you have sex, but remember that condoms reduce but don&#39;t eliminate the risk.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Tell your sexual partner to get tested. Anyone with whom you&#39;ve had sex needs to be tested for the virus. Your partners also need to know their HBV status so that they don&#39;t infect others.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Don&#39;t share implements. If you use IV drugs, never share needles and syringes. And don&#39;t share razor blades or toothbrushes, which may carry traces of infected blood.<br />\r\nCoping and Support<br />\r\nIf you&#39;ve been diagnosed with hepatitis B infection, the following suggestions might help you cope:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Learn about hepatitis B. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is a good place to start.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Stay connected to friends and family. You can&#39;t spread hepatitis B through casual contact, so don&#39;t cut yourself off from people who can offer support.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Take care of yourself. Eat a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Take care of your liver. Don&#39;t drink alcohol. Don&#39;t take prescription or over-the-counter drugs without consulting your doctor. Get tested for hepatitis A and C. Get vaccinated for hepatitis A if you haven&#39;t been exposed.<br />\r\nPrevention<br />\r\nThe hepatitis B vaccine is typically given as three or four injections over six months. You can&#39;t get hepatitis B from the vaccine.<br />\r\nThe hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Newborns<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Children and adolescents not vaccinated at birth<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Anyone who has a sexually transmitted infection, including HIV<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Developmentally disabled people who live in an institutional setting and staff<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Health care workers, emergency workers and other people who come into contact with blood<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Men who have sex with men<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;People who have multiple sexual partners<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;People with chronic liver disease<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;People who inject illicit drugs<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;People who live with someone who has hepatitis B<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;People with end-stage kidney disease<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Sexual partners of someone who has hepatitis B<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Travelers planning to go to an area of the world with a high hepatitis B infection rate<br />\r\nTake precautions to avoid HBV<br />\r\nOther ways to reduce your risk of HBV include:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Know the HBV status of any sexual partner. Don&#39;t engage in unprotected sex unless you&#39;re absolutely certain your partner isn&#39;t infected with HBV or any other sexually transmitted infection.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex if you don&#39;t know the health status of your partner. Remember that although condoms can reduce your risk of contracting HBV, they don&#39;t eliminate the risk.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Stop using illicit drugs. If you use illicit drugs, get help to stop. If you can&#39;t stop, use a sterile needle each time you inject illicit drugs. Never share needles.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Be cautious about body piercing and tattooing.

(10, '', '5062', 'WORLD DIABETES DAY', '<p><em><strong>DIABETES</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>Diabetes</strong> mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how your body uses blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is vital to your health because it&#39;s an important source of energy for the cells that make up your muscles and tissues. It&#39;s also your brain&#39;s main source of fuel.&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://doctorsinservice.com/cms/editor/upload/imgs/what-to-eat-and-avoid-if-you-have-diabetes-video.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:84px; width:150px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have diabetes, no matter what type, it means you have too much glucose in your blood, although the causes may differ. Too much glucose can lead to serious health problems.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Potentially reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes &mdash; when your blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes &mdash; and gestational diabetes, which occurs during pregnancy but may resolve after the baby&nbsp;is delivered.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SYMPTOMS</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diabetes symptoms vary depending on how much your blood sugar is elevated. Some people, especially those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may not experience symptoms initially. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Increased thirst&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Frequent urination&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Extreme hunger&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Unexplained weight loss&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Presence of ketones in the urine (ketones are a&nbsp;byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there&#39;s not enough available insulin)&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Fatigue&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Irritability&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Blurred vision&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Slow-healing sores&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Frequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, it typically appears during childhood or adolescence. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it&#39;s more common in people older than 40.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>When to see a doctor</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;ve already been diagnosed with diabetes. After you receive your diagnosis, you&#39;ll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAUSES</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How insulin works</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach (pancreas).&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The role of glucose</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Glucose &mdash; a sugar &mdash; is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your liver stores and makes glucose.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven&#39;t eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Causes of type 1 diabetes</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system &mdash; which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses &mdash; attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Type 1</strong> is thought to be caused&nbsp;by&nbsp;a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what many of those factors are is still unclear.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In prediabetes &mdash; which can lead to type 2 diabetes &mdash; and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it&#39;s needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it&#39;s believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Causes of gestational diabetes</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Normally, your pancreas responds&nbsp;by&nbsp;producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can&#39;t keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Risk factors&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Risk factors for type 1 diabetes</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Family history.Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Environmental factors. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The presence of damaging immune system cells (autoantibodies). Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dietary factors. These include low vitamin D consumption, early exposure to cow&#39;s milk or cow&#39;s milk formula, and exposure to cereals before 4 months of age. None of these factors has been shown to directly cause type 1 diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Geography. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers don&#39;t fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don&#39;t. It&#39;s clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weight. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Family history. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Race</strong>. Although it&#39;s unclear why, people of certain races &mdash; including blacks, Hispanics, American Indians and Asian-Americans &mdash; are at higher risk.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Age</strong>. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing dramatically among children, adolescents and younger adults.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gestational diabetes</strong>. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes later increases. If you gave birth to a baby&nbsp;weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms), you&#39;re also at risk of type 2 diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Polycystic ovary syndrome</strong>. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome &mdash; a common condition characterized&nbsp;by&nbsp;irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity &mdash; increases the risk of diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>High blood pressure</strong>. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels</strong>. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or &quot;good,&quot; cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Risk factors for gestational diabetes</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any pregnant woman can develop gestational diabetes, but some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Age</strong>. Women older than age 25 are at increased risk.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Family or personal history</strong>. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes &mdash; a precursor to type 2 diabetes &mdash; or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You&#39;re also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby&nbsp;or if you had an unexplained stillbirth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Weight</strong>. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Race</strong>. For reasons that aren&#39;t clear, women who are black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Complications&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes &mdash; and the less controlled your blood sugar &mdash; the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cardiovascular disease</strong>. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis). If you have diabetes, you are more likely to have heart disease or stroke.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nerve damage (neuropathy)</strong>. Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kidney damage (nephropathy)</strong>. The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters (glomeruli) that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eye damage (retinopathy)</strong>. Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina (diabetic retinopathy), potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Foot damage</strong>. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Skin conditions</strong>. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hearing impairment.</strong> Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alzheimer&#39;s disease</strong>. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of Alzheimer&#39;s disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Complications of gestational diabetes</strong></em>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Complications in your baby&nbsp;can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Excess growth</strong>. Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby&#39;s pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby&nbsp;to grow too large (macrosomia). Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Low blood sugar</strong>. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby&#39;s blood sugar level to normal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Type 2 diabetes later in life.</strong> Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Death</strong>. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby&#39;s death either before or shortly after birth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Complications in the mother can also occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Preeclampsia</strong>.This condition is characterized&nbsp;by&nbsp;high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsequent gestational diabetes. Once you&#39;ve had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you&#39;re more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You&#39;re also more likely to develop diabetes &mdash; typically type 2 diabetes &mdash; as you get older.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Complications of prediabetes&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prediabetes may develop into type 2 diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Preparing for your appointment&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&#39;re likely to start&nbsp;by&nbsp;seeing your primary care doctor if you&#39;re having diabetes symptoms. If your child is having diabetes symptoms, you might see your child&#39;s pediatrician. If blood sugar levels are extremely high, you&#39;ll likely be sent to the emergency room.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If blood sugar levels aren&#39;t high enough to put you or your child immediately at risk, you may be referred to a doctor who specializes in diabetes, among other disorders (endocrinologist). Soon after diagnosis, you&#39;ll also likely meet with a diabetes educator and a dietitian to get more information on managing your diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&#39;s some information to help you get ready for your appointment and to know what to expect.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What you can do&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Be aware of any pre-appointment restrictions. When you make the appointment, ask if you need to do anything in advance. This will likely include restricting your diet, such as for a fasting blood sugar test.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Write down any symptoms you&#39;re experiencing, including any that may seem unrelated.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Write down key personal information, including major stresses or recent life changes. If you&#39;re monitoring your glucose values at home, bring a record of the glucose results, detailing the dates and times of testing.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Make a list of any allergies you have and all medications, vitamins and supplements you&#39;re taking.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Record your family medical history. In particular, note any relatives who have had diabetes, heart attacks or strokes.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Take a family member or friend, if possible. Someone who accompanies you can help you remember information you need.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Write down questions to ask your doctor. Ask about aspects of your diabetes management you&#39;re unclear about.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Be aware if you need any prescription refills. Your doctor can renew your prescriptions while you&#39;re there.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Preparing a list of questions can help you make the most of your time with your doctor. For diabetes, some questions to ask include:</strong></em>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Are the symptoms I&#39;m having related to diabetes or something else?&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Do I need any tests?&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>What else can I do to protect my health?&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>What are other options to manage my diabetes?&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>I have other health conditions. How can I best manage these conditions together?&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Are there restrictions I need to follow?&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Should I see another specialist, such as a dietitian or diabetes educator?&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you&#39;re prescribing?&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Are there brochures or other printed material I can take with me? What websites do you recommend?&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>What to expect from your doctor</strong></em>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions, such as:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Can you describe your symptoms?&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Do you have symptoms all the time, or do they come and go?&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>How severe are your symptoms?&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Do you have a family history of preeclampsia or diabetes?&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tell me about your diet.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Do you exercise? What type and how much?&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Tests and diagnosis&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Symptoms of type 1 diabetes often appear suddenly and are often the reason for checking blood sugar levels. Because symptoms of other types of diabetes and prediabetes come on more gradually or may not be evident, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has recommended screening guidelines. The ADA recommends that the following people be screened for diabetes:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone with a body mass index higher than 25, regardless of age, who has additional risk factors, such as high blood pressure, a sedentary lifestyle, a history of polycystic ovary syndrome, having delivered a baby&nbsp;who weighed more than 9 pounds, a history of diabetes in pregnancy, high cholesterol levels, a history of heart disease, and having a close relative with diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone older than age 45 is advised to receive an initial blood sugar screening, and then, if the results are normal, to be screened every three years thereafter.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tests for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and prediabetes&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test. This blood test indicates your average blood sugar level for the past two to three months. It measures the percentage of blood sugar attached to hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells. The higher your blood sugar levels, the more hemoglobin you&#39;ll have with sugar attached. An A1C level of 6.5 percent or higher on two separate tests indicates that you have diabetes. An A1C between 5.7 and 6.4 percent indicates prediabetes. Below 5.7 is considered normal.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>If the A1C test results aren&#39;t consistent, the test isn&#39;t available, or if you have certain conditions that can make the A1C test inaccurate &mdash; such as if you&#39;re pregnant or have an uncommon form of hemoglobin (known as a hemoglobin variant) &mdash; your doctor may use the following tests to diagnose diabetes:&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Random blood sugar test. A blood sample will be taken at a random time. Regardless of when you last ate, a random blood sugar level of 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) &mdash; 11.1 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) &mdash; or higher suggests diabetes.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Fasting blood sugar test. A blood sample will be taken after an overnight fast. A fasting blood sugar level less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is normal. A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) is considered prediabetes. If it&#39;s 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests, you have diabetes.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Oral glucose tolerance test. For this test, you fast overnight, and the fasting blood sugar level is measured. Then you drink a sugary liquid, and blood sugar levels are tested periodically for the next two hours. A blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) is normal. A reading of more than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) after two hours indicates diabetes. A reading between 140 and 199 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L and 11.0 mmol/L) indicates prediabetes.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>If type 1 diabetes is suspected, your urine will be tested to look for the presence of a&nbsp;byproduct produced when muscle and fat tissue are used for energy when the body doesn&#39;t have enough insulin to use the available glucose (ketones). Your doctor will also likely run a test to see if you have the destructive immune system cells associated with type 1 diabetes called autoantibodies.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tests for gestational diabetes</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will likely evaluate your risk factors for gestational diabetes early in your pregnancy:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re at high risk of gestational diabetes &mdash; for example, if you were obese at the start of your pregnancy, you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, or you have a mother, father, sibling or child with diabetes &mdash; your doctor may test for diabetes at your first prenatal visit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;re at average risk of gestational diabetes, you&#39;ll likely have a screening test for gestational diabetes sometime during your second trimester &mdash; typically between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor may use the following screening tests:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initial glucose challenge test. You&#39;ll begin the glucose challenge test&nbsp;by&nbsp;drinking a syrupy glucose solution. One hour later, you&#39;ll have a blood test to measure your blood sugar level. A blood sugar level below 140 mg/dL (7.2 to 7.8 mmol/L) is usually considered normal on a glucose challenge test, although this may vary at specific&nbsp;clinics or labs. If your blood sugar level is higher than normal, it only means you have a higher risk of gestational diabetes. Your doctor will order a follow-up test to determine if you have gestational diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow-up glucose tolerance testing. For the follow-up test, you&#39;ll be asked to fast overnight and then have your fasting blood sugar level measured. Then you&#39;ll drink another sweet solution &mdash; this one containing a higher concentration of glucose &mdash; and your blood sugar level will be checked every hour for a period of three hours. If at least two of the blood sugar readings are higher than the normal values established for each of the three hours of the test, you&#39;ll be diagnosed with gestational diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Treatments and drugs&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on what type of diabetes you have, blood sugar monitoring, insulin and oral medications may play a role in your treatment. Eating a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight and participating in regular activity also are important factors in managing diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatments for all types of diabetes&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important part of managing diabetes &mdash; as well as your overall health &mdash; is maintaining a healthy weight through a healthy diet and exercise plan:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Healthy eating. Contrary to popular perception, there&#39;s no specific diabetes diet. You&#39;ll need to center your diet on more fruits, vegetables and whole grains &mdash; foods that are high in nutrition and fiber and low in fat and calories &mdash; and cut down on animal products, refined carbohydrates and sweets. In fact, it&#39;s the best eating plan for the entire family. Sugary foods are OK once in a while, as long as they&#39;re counted as part of your meal plan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet understanding what and how much to eat can be a challenge. A registered dietitian can help you create a meal plan that fits your health goals, food preferences and lifestyle. This will likely include carbohydrate counting, especially if you have type 1 diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Physical activity. Everyone needs regular aerobic exercise, and people who have diabetes are no exception. Exercise lowers your blood sugar level&nbsp;by&nbsp;moving sugar into your cells, where it&#39;s used for energy. Exercise also increases your sensitivity to insulin, which means your body needs less insulin to transport sugar to your cells. Get your doctor&#39;s OK to exercise. Then choose activities you enjoy, such as walking, swimming or biking. What&#39;s most important is making physical activity part of your daily routine. Aim for at least 30 minutes or more of aerobic exercise most days of the week. If you haven&#39;t been active for a while, start slowly and build up gradually.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Treatments for type 1 and type 2 diabetes</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment for type 1 diabetes involves insulin injections or the use of an insulin pump, frequent blood sugar checks, and carbohydrate counting. Treatment of type 2 diabetes primarily involves monitoring of your blood sugar, along with diabetes medications, insulin or both.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monitoring your blood sugar. Depending on your treatment plan, you may check and record your blood sugar as often as several times a week to as many as four to eight times a day. Careful monitoring is the only way to make sure that your blood sugar level remains within your target range. People who receive insulin therapy also may choose to monitor their blood sugar levels with a continuous glucose monitor. Although this technology doesn&#39;t yet replace the glucose meter, it can provide important information about trends in blood sugar levels.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with careful management, blood sugar levels can sometimes change unpredictably. With help from your diabetes treatment team, you&#39;ll learn how your blood sugar level changes in response to food, physical activity, medications, illness, alcohol, stress &mdash; for women, fluctuations in hormone levels.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to daily blood sugar monitoring, your doctor will likely recommend regular A1C testing to measure your average blood sugar level for the past two to three months. Compared with repeated daily blood sugar tests, A1C testing better indicates how well your diabetes treatment plan is working overall. An elevated A1C level may signal the need for a change in your insulin regimen or meal plan. Your target A1C goal may vary depending on your age and various other factors. However, for most people with diabetes, the American Diabetes Association recommends an A1C of below 7 percent. Ask your doctor what your A1C target is.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insulin. People with type 1 diabetes need insulin therapy to survive. Many people with type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes also need insulin therapy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many types of insulin are available, including rapid-acting insulin, long-acting insulin and intermediate options. Depending on your needs, your doctor may prescribe a mixture of insulin types to use throughout the day and night.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insulin can&#39;t be taken orally to lower blood sugar because stomach enzymes interfere with insulin&#39;s action. Often insulin is injected using a fine needle and syringe or an insulin pen &mdash; a device that looks like a large ink pen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An insulin pump may also be an option. The pump is a device about the size of a cellphone worn on the outside of your body. A tube connects the reservoir of insulin to a catheter that&#39;s inserted under the skin of your abdomen. A tubeless pump that works wirelessly is also now available. You program an insulin pump to dispense specific amounts of insulin. It can be adjusted to deliver more or less insulin depending on meals, activity level and blood sugar level.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An emerging treatment approach, not yet available, is closed loop insulin delivery, also known as the artificial pancreas. It links a continuous glucose monitor to an insulin pump. The device automatically delivers the correct amount of insulin when the monitor indicates the need for it. There are a number of different versions of the artificial pancreas, and&nbsp;clinical trials have had encouraging results. More research needs to be done before a fully functional artificial pancreas can receive regulatory approval.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the first step toward an artificial pancreas was approved in 2013. Combining a continuous glucose monitor with an insulin pump, this system stops insulin delivery when blood sugar levels drop too low. Studies on the device found that it could prevent low blood sugar levels overnight without significantly increasing morning blood sugar levels.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oral or other medications. Sometimes other oral or injected medications are prescribed as well. Some diabetes medications stimulate your pancreas to produce and release more insulin. Others inhibit the production and release of glucose from your liver, which means you need less insulin to transport sugar into your cells. Still others block the action of stomach or intestinal enzymes that break down carbohydrates or make your tissues more sensitive to insulin. Metformin (Glucophage, Glumetza, others) is generally the first medication prescribed for type 2 diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transplantation. In some people who have type 1 diabetes, a pancreas transplant may be an option. Islet transplants are being studied as well. With a successful pancreas transplant, you would no longer need insulin therapy. But transplants aren&#39;t always successful &mdash; and these procedures pose serious risks. You need a lifetime of immune-suppressing drugs to prevent organ rejection. These drugs can have serious side effects, including a high risk of infection, organ injury and cancer. Because the side effects can be more dangerous than the diabetes, transplants are usually reserved for people whose diabetes can&#39;t be controlled or those who also need a kidney transplant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bariatric surgery. Although it is not specifically considered a treatment for type 2 diabetes, people with type 2 diabetes who also have a body mass index higher than 35 may benefit from this type of surgery. People who&#39;ve undergone gastric&nbsp;bypass have seen significant improvements in their blood sugar levels. However, this procedure&#39;s long-term risks and benefits for type 2 diabetes aren&#39;t yet known.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment for gestational diabetes&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Controlling your blood sugar level is essential to keeping your baby&nbsp;healthy and avoiding complications during delivery. In addition to maintaining a healthy diet and exercising, your treatment plan may include monitoring your blood sugar and, in some cases, using insulin or oral medications.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your health care provider will also monitor your blood sugar level during labor. If your blood sugar rises, your baby&nbsp;may release high levels of insulin &mdash; which can lead to low blood sugar right after birth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment for prediabetes&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have prediabetes, healthy lifestyle choices can help you bring your blood sugar level back to normal or at least keep it from rising toward the levels seen in type 2 diabetes. Maintaining a healthy weight through exercise and healthy eating can help. Exercising at least 150 minutes a week and losing 5 to 10 percent of your body weight may prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes medications &mdash; such as metformin (Glucophage, Glumetza, others) &mdash; also are an option if you&#39;re at high risk of diabetes, including when your prediabetes is worsening or if you have cardiovascular disease, fatty liver disease or polycystic ovary syndrome.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other cases, medications to control cholesterol &mdash; statins, in particular &mdash; and high blood pressure medications are needed. Your doctor might prescribe low-dose aspirin therapy to help prevent cardiovascular disease if you&#39;re at high risk. Healthy lifestyle choices remain key, however.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Signs of trouble in any type of diabetes&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because so many factors can affect your blood sugar, problems may sometimes arise that require immediate care, such as:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>High blood sugar (hyperglycemia). Your blood sugar level can rise for many reasons, including eating too much, being sick or not taking enough glucose-lowering medication. Check your blood sugar level as directed&nbsp;by&nbsp;your doctor, and watch for signs and symptoms of high blood sugar &mdash; frequent urination, increased thirst, dry mouth, blurred vision, fatigue and nausea. If you have hyperglycemia, you&#39;ll need to adjust your meal plan, medications or both.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Increased ketones in your urine (diabetic ketoacidosis). If your cells are starved for energy, your body may begin to break down fat. This produces toxic acids known as ketones. Watch for loss of appetite, weakness, vomiting, fever, stomach pain and a sweet, fruity breath. You can check your urine for excess ketones with an over-the-counter ketones test kit. If you have excess ketones in your urine, consult your doctor right away or seek emergency care. This condition is more common in people with type 1 diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome. Signs and symptoms of this life-threatening condition include a blood sugar reading over 600 mg/dL (33.3 mmol/L), dry mouth, extreme thirst, fever, drowsiness, confusion, vision loss and hallucinations. Hyperosmolar syndrome is caused&nbsp;by&nbsp;sky-high blood sugar that turns blood thick and syrupy. It tends to be more common in people with type 2 diabetes, and it&#39;s often preceded&nbsp;by&nbsp;an illness. Call your doctor or seek immediate medical care if you have signs or symptoms of this condition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). If your blood sugar level drops below your target range, it&#39;s known as low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Your blood sugar level can drop for many reasons, including skipping a meal and getting more physical activity than normal. However, low blood sugar is most likely if you take glucose-lowering medications that promote the secretion of insulin&nbsp;by&nbsp;your pancreas or if you&#39;re receiving insulin therapy. Check your blood sugar level regularly, and watch for signs and symptoms of low blood sugar &mdash; sweating, shakiness, weakness, hunger, dizziness, headache, blurred vision, heart palpitations, irritability, slurred speech, drowsiness, confusion, fainting and seizures. Low blood sugar is treated with quickly absorbed carbohydrates, such as fruit juice or glucose tablets.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lifestyle and home remedies&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diabetes is a serious disease. Following your diabetes treatment plan takes round-the-clock commitment. Careful management of diabetes can reduce your risk of serious &mdash; even life-threatening &mdash; complications.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter what type of diabetes you have:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make a commitment to managing your diabetes. Learn all you can about diabetes. Establish a relationship with a diabetes educator, and ask your diabetes treatment team for help when you need it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choose healthy foods and maintain a healthy weight. Losing just 7 percent of your body weight if you&#39;re overweight can make a significant difference in your blood sugar control. A healthy diet is one with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes, with a limited amount of saturated fat.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make physical activity part of your daily routine. Regular exercise can help prevent prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and it can help those who already have diabetes to maintain better blood sugar control. Thirty minutes of moderate exercise &mdash; such as brisk walking &mdash; most days of the week is recommended. A combination of exercises &mdash; aerobic exercises, such as walking or dancing on most days, combined with resistance training, such as weightlifting or yoga twice a week &mdash; often helps control blood sugar more effectively than does either type of exercise alone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lifestyle for type 1 and type 2 diabetes</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, if you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Identify yourself. Wear a tag or bracelet that says you have diabetes. Keep a glucagon kit nearby&nbsp;in case of a low blood sugar emergency &mdash; and make sure your friends and loved ones know how to use it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schedule a yearly physical and regular eye exams. Your regular diabetes checkups aren&#39;t meant to replace yearly physicals or routine eye exams. During the physical, your doctor will look for any diabetes-related complications and screen for other medical problems. Your eye care specialist will check for signs of retinal damage, cataracts and glaucoma.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep your vaccinations up to date. High blood sugar can weaken your immune system. Get a flu shot every year, and your doctor may recommend the pneumonia vaccine, as well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also currently recommends hepatitis B vaccination if you haven&#39;t previously been vaccinated against hepatitis B and you&#39;re an adult ages 19 to 59 with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The most recent CDC guidelines advise vaccination as soon as possible after diagnosis with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. If you are age 60 or older, have diabetes, and haven&#39;t previously received the vaccine, talk to your doctor about whether it&#39;s right for you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pay attention to your feet. Wash your feet daily in lukewarm water. Dry them gently, especially between the toes. Moisturize with lotion, but not between the toes. Check your feet every day for blisters, cuts, sores, redness or swelling. Consult your doctor if you have a sore or other foot problem that doesn&#39;t heal promptly on its own.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol under control. Eating healthy foods and exercising regularly can go a long way toward controlling high blood pressure and cholesterol. Medication may be needed, too.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take care of your teeth. Diabetes may leave you prone to more-serious gum infections. Brush and floss your teeth at least twice a day. And if you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, schedule regular dental exams. Consult your dentist right away if your gums bleed or look red or swollen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you smoke or use other types of tobacco, ask your doctor to help you quit. Smoking increases your risk of various diabetes complications. Smokers who have diabetes are more likely to die of cardiovascular disease than are nonsmokers who have diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association. Talk to your doctor about ways to stop smoking or to stop using other types of tobacco.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you drink alcohol, do so responsibly. Alcohol can cause either high or low blood sugar, depending on how much you drink and if you eat at the same time. If you choose to drink, do so only in moderation &mdash; one drink a day for women of all ages and men older than 65, and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger &mdash; and always with food.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember to include the carbohydrates from any alcohol you drink in your daily carbohydrate count. And check your blood sugar levels before going to bed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take stress seriously. The hormones your body may produce in response to prolonged stress may prevent insulin from working properly, which will raise your blood sugar and stress you even more. Set limits for yourself and prioritize your tasks. Learn relaxation techniques. And get plenty of sleep.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prevention&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Type 1 diabetes can&#39;t be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eat healthy foods. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get more physical activity. Aim for 30 minutes of moderate physical activity a day. Take a brisk daily walk. Ride your bike. Swim laps. If you can&#39;t fit in a long workout, break it up into smaller sessions spread throughout the day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lose excess pounds. If you&#39;re overweight, losing even 7 percent of your body weight &mdash; for example, 14 pounds (6.4 kilograms) if you weigh 200 pounds (90.9 kilograms) &mdash; can reduce the risk of diabetes. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself&nbsp;by&nbsp;remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes medication is an option as well. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin (Glucophage, Glumetza, others) may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes &mdash; but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven&#39;t developed type 2 diabetes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org\" target=\"_blank\">Mayo Clinic</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'diabetes.jpg', '', '2017-11-14', '', ''),

(19, '', '5062', 'Obesity', '<h3><big><strong>How do I know if I am obese?</strong></big></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><big><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://doctorsinservice.com/cms/editor/upload/imgs/obesity leads.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:183px; width:275px\" /></strong></big></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obesity is defined as an excess proportion of total body fat. Speak with your doctor if you are concerned about your weight and if you are attempting weight loss. You should call your doctor if you need help in losing weight or if you fall into either of these categories:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Body mass index (BMI):</strong>&nbsp;If your BMI is 30 or greater, you&#39;re considered obese and should talk to your doctor about losing weight for your health.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Waist circumference:</strong>&nbsp;If you have an &quot;apple shape&quot; &mdash; a &quot;potbelly&quot; or &quot;spare tire&quot; &mdash; you carry more fat in and around your abdominal organs. Fat in your abdomen increases your risk of many of the serious conditions associated with obesity. Women&#39;s waist measurement should fall below 35 inches. Men&#39;s should be less than 40 inches. If you have a large waist circumference, talk to your doctor about weight loss.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Can being overweight lead to medical problems?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes. Being overweight is linked to a number of health problems, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Heart disease and stroke</li>\r\n	<li>High blood pressure</li>\r\n	<li>Diabetes</li>\r\n	<li>Cancer</li>\r\n	<li>Gallbladder disease and gallstones</li>\r\n	<li>Osteoarthritis</li>\r\n	<li>Gout</li>\r\n	<li>Breathing problems, such as sleep apnea (when a person stops breathing for a short time during sleep) and asthma</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Someone who is 40% overweight is twice as likely to die prematurely as an average-weight person. (This effect is seen after 10 to 30 years of being obese.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctors generally agree that the more obese a person is, the more likely it is that he or she will have health problems. People who are 20% or more overweight can gain significant health benefits from weight loss. Many obesity experts believe that people who are less than 20% above their healthy weight should try to lose weight if they have any of the following risk factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Family history of certain chronic diseases:</strong>&nbsp;People with close relatives who have had heart disease or diabetes are more likely to develop these problems if they are obese.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Pre-existing medical conditions:&nbsp;</strong>High blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, or high blood sugar levels are all warning signs of some obesity-associated diseases.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>&quot;Apple&quot; shape:</strong>&nbsp;People whose weight is concentrated around the abdomen may be at greater risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, or cancer than people of the same weight who are &quot;pear-shaped.&quot;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, even a modest weight loss of 10 to 20 pounds can bring significant health improvements, such as lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What causes obesity?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In scientific terms, obesity occurs when a person&#39;s calorie intake exceeds the amount of energy he or she burns. What causes this imbalance between consuming and burning calories is unclear. Evidence suggests that obesity often has more than one cause. Environmental, psychological, genetic, and other factors all may play a part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Environmental factors:&nbsp;</strong>A person&#39;s environment plays a significant role in weight status. Environment includes lifestyle behaviors, such as what a person eats and how active he or she is. Americans tend to have high-fat diets, often putting taste and convenience ahead of nutritional content when choosing meals. People can change what they eat and how active they are as a means of changing their weight status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Psychological factors:</strong>&nbsp;Psychological factors also may influence eating habits. Many people eat in response to negative emotions such as boredom, sadness, or anger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About 30% of those who seek treatment for serious weight problems have difficulties with binge eating. During a binge eating episode, people eat large amounts of food while feeling they can&#39;t control how much they are eating. Those with the most severe binge eating problems are considered to have what is called binge eating disorder. These people may have more difficulty losing weight and keeping the weight off than people without binge eating problems. Some will need special help, such as counseling or medication, to control their binge eating before they can successfully manage their weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Genetic factors:</strong>&nbsp;Obesity tends to run in families, suggesting that it may have a genetic cause. However, family members share not only genes but also diet and lifestyle habits that may contribute to obesity. Separating these lifestyle factors from genetic ones is often difficult. Still, growing evidence points to heredity as a strong determining factor of obesity. In one study of adults who were adopted as children, researchers found that their subjects&#39; adult weights were closer to their biological parents&#39; weights than their adoptive parents&#39;. The environment provided by the adoptive family apparently had less influence on the development of obesity than the person&#39;s genetic makeup. However, many people genetically predisposed to obesity do not become obese or are able to lose weight and keep it off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other causes of obesity:</strong>&nbsp;Some illnesses can lower the metabolism or trigger an increased appetite which can cause obesity. These include hypothyroidism, Cushing&#39;s syndrome, depression, and certain neurologic problems. Certain drugs, such as steroids and some antidepressants, may cause excessive weight gain through the same methods. A doctor can determine if a patient has any of these conditions, which are believed to be responsible for only about 1% of all cases of obesity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><big><strong>How is Obesity Managed and Treated?</strong></big></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How is obesity treated?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The treatment of obesity needs to be long-term; it cannot be short-term. Weight loss should be gradual, and careful follow-up is necessary to prevent rebound weight gain. Changing behavior and lifestyle are the only ways to change a person&#39;s weight permanently. These changes focus on gradual and permanent changes in eating and exercise habits. There are six ways you can change your behavior and lifestyle that will help you maintain weight loss:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Learning about nutrition</li>\r\n	<li>Changing your eating habits</li>\r\n	<li>Increasing your physical activity</li>\r\n	<li>Changing your attitudes about eating</li>\r\n	<li>Joining a weight loss program</li>\r\n	<li>Developing support systems</li>\r\n	<li>Following any drug therapies ordered by your doctor</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The keys to weight management include making lifestyle changes, such as increasing exercise and activity and changing dietary habits.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What about prescription weight loss medications?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Prescription drugs are another approach to treating obesity. Drug therapy may help the patient learn and adapt to a healthier lifestyle. It should be used along with a program of diet and exercise and should help you follow your overall treatment plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The anti-obesity medications that are currently available work mainly by suppressing the appetite. They raise specific hormones such as noradrenalin or serotonin in the nervous system, creating a feeling of fullness. These medications will not work, however, unless you also make changes in your diet and lifestyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The level of success with anti-obesity drugs is rather modest. Studies show a mean weight loss of six to 10 pounds total and about one-half pound a week greater weight loss than with a placebo (for 12 weeks or less of treatment). Some individuals respond very well while others may not respond at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A weight loss medication is not a cure-all. The use of weight loss medications should be combined with physical activity and improved diet to lose and maintain weight successfully over the long term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weight loss medications can be considered for:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>People with a BMI greater than 30 with no obesity-related conditions</li>\r\n	<li>People with a BMI of greater than 27 with two or more obesity-related conditions</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, most available weight-loss medications approved by the FDA are for short-term use, meaning a few weeks or months.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What about weight loss surgery?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Another treatment option may be surgery. Surgery should only be considered after all other attempts to lose weight have been unsuccessful, or if a person has an obesity-related disease. Surgery should only be done at centers committed to long-term follow-up and as an addition to diet, exercise, and behavior modification programs. Currently, candidates for these surgeries have to be:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Severely obese (A BMI greater than 35)</li>\r\n	<li>Well-informed</li>\r\n	<li>Assessed by dietician, psychologist, endocrinologist, and other specialists before being considered for the procedure</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Surgical procedures have had the most long-term success, but it is important to consider the reasons for success or failure of previous weight-loss attempts as well as the risks and benefits of the surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<big><strong>Prevention of Obesity</strong></big></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How much exercise should I do?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies show that even the most inactive people can gain significant health benefits if they accumulate just 30 minutes or more of physical activity per day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the greatest overall health benefits, experts suggest 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise three or more times per week, plus some form of anaerobic exercise, such as muscle-strengthening activity and stretching twice a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have been inactive for a while, you may want to start with less strenuous activities, such as walking or swimming at a comfortable pace. Beginning at a slow pace will allow you to become physically fit without straining your body. Once you are in better shape, you can gradually do more strenuous activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How can I lose weight and then prevent gaining it back?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep the following tips in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Set realistic weight loss goals, such as a one- to two-pound weight loss per week. Those who lose weight slowly, by eating less and exercising more, tend to keep their lost weight off. Even a half pound weight loss per week would result in a 25-pound loss over one year.</li>\r\n	<li>Eat fewer calories by cutting down on portion sizes. An easy way to portion a plate is to put fruits and vegetables on half, starch on one quarter of the plate, and protein on the other quarter of the plate.</li>\r\n	<li>Aim for at least five handfuls of fruits and vegetables per day.</li>\r\n	<li>Do not skip meals. This slows down metabolism and can lead to increased hunger and binging. Four to five &ldquo;mini-meals&rdquo; regularly spaced throughout the day may help satisfy your hunger while keeping your weight under control.</li>\r\n	<li>Feel free to include planned, healthy snacks between meals if you find you struggle with physical hunger during the day. Some examples would be fat-free Greek yogurt, cottage cheese and fruit, vegetables and hummus, string cheese and fresh fruit, or a palm full of nuts.</li>\r\n	<li>Choose foods high in fiber, such as whole grain breads, cereals, pasta, rice, fruits, and vegetables.

By knowing the telltale clues, you can tell much about&nbsp;what&rsquo;s going on &mdash; and whether it&rsquo;s time to see the doctor for further followup. Listen closely: Is your body trying to tell you something?</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2><strong>What Your Tongue Can Tell You About Your Health</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Reasons why you should &lsquo;watch&rsquo; your tongue</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For clues about problems in your mouth, stick out your tongue and look in the mirror. A healthy tongue should be pink and covered with small nodules (papillae). Any deviation from your tongue&rsquo;s normal appearance, or any&nbsp;pain, may be cause for concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"tongue\" src=\"http://doctorsinservice.com/cms/editor/upload/imgs/iStock_000020924985_Large-tongue-275.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:150px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>If your tongue has a white coating or white spots</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A white tongue, or white spots on your tongue, could be an indication of:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Oral thrush</strong>: a yeast infection that develops inside the mouth. It appears as white patches that are often the consistency of cottage cheese. &ldquo;Oral thrush&nbsp;is most commonly seen in infants and the elderly, especially denture wearers, or in people with weakened immune systems,&rdquo; says Dr. Allan. &ldquo;People with&nbsp;diabetes&nbsp;and those who are taking inhaled steroids for asthma or lung disease can also get it. Oral thrush is more likely to occur after you&rsquo;ve taken antibiotics.&rdquo;</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Leukoplakia</strong>: a condition in which the cells in the mouth grow excessively, which leads to white patches on the tongue and inside the mouth. &ldquo;Leukoplakia can develop when the tongue has been irritated,&rdquo; Dr. Allan says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s often seen in people who use&nbsp;tobacco&nbsp;products. Leukoplakia can be a precursor to cancer, but isn&rsquo;t inherently dangerous by itself. If you see what you think could be leukoplakia, contact your dentist for an evaluation.&rdquo;</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Oral lichen planus</strong>: a network of raised white lines on your tongue that look similar to lace. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t always know what causes this condition, but it usually resolves on its own,&rdquo; <strong>says Dr. Allan.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>If your tongue is red</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A red tongue could be a sign of:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Vitamin deficiency</strong>: &ldquo;Folic acid and vitamin B-12 deficiencies may cause your tongue to take on a reddish appearance,&rdquo; Dr. Allan says.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Geographic tongue</strong>: This condition causes a map-like pattern of reddish spots to develop on the surface of your tongue. &ldquo;These patches can have a white border around them, and their location on your tongue may shift over time,&rdquo; says Dr. Allan. &ldquo;Geographic tongue is usually harmless.&rdquo;</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Scarlet fever:&nbsp;</strong>an infection that causes the tongue to have a strawberry-like (red and bumpy) appearance. &ldquo;If you have a high fever and a red tongue, you need to see your family doctor,&rdquo; Dr. Allan says. &ldquo;Antibiotics are necessary to treat scarlet fever.&rdquo;</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Kawasaki disease:&nbsp;</strong>a condition that can also cause the tongue to have a strawberry-like appearance. It is seen in children under the age of 5 and is accompanied by a high fever. &ldquo;Kawasaki syndrome is a serious condition that demands immediate medical evaluation,&rdquo; says Dr. Allan.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>If your tongue is black and hairy</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Much like hair, the papillae on your tongue grow throughout your lifetime. In some people, they become excessively long, which makes them more likely to harbor bacteria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When these&nbsp;bacteria&nbsp;grow, they may look dark or black, and the overgrown papillae can appear hair-like,&rdquo; Dr. Allan says. &ldquo;Fortunately, this condition is not common and is typically not serious. It&rsquo;s most likely to occur in people who don&rsquo;t practice good&nbsp;dental hygiene.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He says people with diabetes, taking antibiotics or receiving chemotherapy may also develop a black hairy tongue.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>If your tongue is sore or bumpy</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Painful bumps on your tongue can be due to:</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Trauma:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Accidentally biting your tongue or scalding it on something straight out of the oven can result in a sore tongue until the damage heals,&rdquo; says Dr. Allan. &ldquo;Grinding or clenching your teeth can also irritate the sides of your tongue and cause it to become painful.&rdquo;</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Smoking:</strong>&nbsp;Smoking irritates your tongue, which can cause soreness.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Canker sores:</strong>&nbsp;mouth ulcers. &ldquo;Many people develop&nbsp;canker sores&nbsp;on the tongue at one time or another,&rdquo; Dr. Allan says. &ldquo;The cause is unknown, but stress is believed to be a factor.&rdquo; Canker sores normally heal without treatment within a week or two.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Oral cancer:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;A lump or sore on your tongue that doesn&rsquo;t go away within two weeks could be an indication of&nbsp;oral cancer,&rdquo; says Dr. Allan. &ldquo;Keep in mind that many oral cancers don&rsquo;t hurt in the early stages, so don&rsquo;t assume a lack of pain means nothing is wrong.&rdquo;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Watch your tongue!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Allan says everyone should check their tongue on a daily basis when they brush their teeth and tongue. &ldquo;Any discoloration, lumps, sores or pain should be monitored and evaluated by a medical professional if they don&rsquo;t go away within two weeks,&rdquo; he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"http://my.cleavelandclinic.org\" target=\"_blank\">Source: My Cleaveland Clinic</a></em></p>\r\n', 'tongue.jpg', '', '2018-10-12', '', ''),

We asked seven dietitians for the single most important weight loss tip they share with patients. May their tips offer you some inspiration:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tip 1: Don&rsquo;t let hunger deter you from sticking with your diet.</strong><br />\r\nWhatever diet you choose &mdash; and many different diets can help you lose weight &mdash; don&rsquo;t give up because you get too hungry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Hunger is one reason many people don&rsquo;t stick with a weight loss plan for more than a few weeks. When you eat less, your fat cells release more hunger hormones, which increases your appetite,&rdquo; says Dawn Noe, RD, LD, CDE. &ldquo;Higher-protein, lower-carbohydrate meal plans are best for controlling your hunger and appetite.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you have diabetes, a diet with fewer carbs (like bread, pasta, rice, desserts, sugary beverages, juice) is also important because you&rsquo;ll need less insulin. And that can help prevent hunger, fat storage and weight gain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Replace processed carbs like white bread, bagels, muffins or donuts for breakfast with high-protein foods like eggs, or Greek yogurt mixed with chia seeds and berries. You&rsquo;ll find that you stay fuller, longer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tip 2: Don&rsquo;t eat a carbohydrate unless it has fiber attached to it.</strong><br />\r\n&ldquo;This method forces you to forgo the bad carbs (candy, white bread, soda) and stick only with high-quality carbs,&rdquo; says Kristin Kirkpatrick, MS, RD, LD. &ldquo;The more fiber in your diet, the better!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiber helps improve blood sugar control, helps lower cholesterol, and reduces your risk of chronic diseases like diabetes, colorectal cancer and heart disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foods rich in fiber include legumes (dried beans, lentils), veggies (Brussels sprouts, broccoli, spinach squash, sweet potatoes) and fruit (apples, berries, oranges, pears).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tip 3: Focus on healthy behaviors, not the number on the scale.</strong><br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s easy to get discouraged when you look only at your weight. &ldquo;Focus instead on making good food choices, watching portions and exercising regularly,&rdquo; says Anna Taylor, MS, RD, LD. &ldquo;If you lead with these behaviors, the weight loss will follow.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Replace a goal like &ldquo;lose 2 pounds a week&rdquo; with specific mini-goals, like &ldquo;eat 1 cup of veggies at dinner,&rdquo; &ldquo;walk 20 minutes a day,&rdquo; or &ldquo;keep a daily food log.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re disappointed with your weight progress at week&rsquo;s end, reflect on how well you stuck to each goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve made healthy changes, congratulations!&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;If you fell short, ask yourself why. Were the goals too difficult? Do you need a stronger support system? Is a major barrier in your way? Then either tweak your goals or focus on the factors you can control.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try tracking lifestyle changes, food, exercise and weight in a journal. At the end of each week, check off which new habits are going well and which need more work. &ldquo;Your health is a lifelong journey,&rdquo; she says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tip 4: Make plants the foundation of your diet.</strong><br />\r\nDifferent weight loss approaches work for different people. But plant foods should be the foundation of any diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Research strongly supports the benefits of plant-based nutrition approaches for weight loss, disease prevention, and overall health,&rdquo; says Brigid Titgemeier, MS, RDN, LD. &ldquo;Whether you&rsquo;re eating vegetarian, paleo, high-fat, vegan or pegan (a combination of paleo and vegan), your diet should include a variety of foods from the earth.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That means enjoying lots of non-starchy vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, kale, cucumbers and bok choy, and fruits like berries, apples and pears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plant-based foods contain a variety of vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients that help support your cells and reduce inflammation, she says. They also provide fiber and water, both of which help you feel fuller.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tip 5: No foods are 100 percent off-limits.</strong><br />\r\nWhen you label foods as &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; you naturally fixate on foods you shouldn&rsquo;t eat but typically still crave &mdash;and likely will crave more when they&rsquo;re totally off limits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Focus instead on choosing the right portions of healthy foods 80 to 90 percent of the time,&rdquo; says Jennifer Willoughby, RD, CSP, LD. &ldquo;That, paired with a healthy exercise routine, can lead to long-term weight loss success. And it leaves some wiggle room to enjoy &lsquo;fun foods&rsquo; occasionally without feeling guilt or resentment.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When working with children, she teaches them which choices are better and will fuel their bodies more effectively, rather than giving them lists of foods to eat and foods to completely avoid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feelings of guilt from eating forbidden foods can snowball into unhealthy emotions in childhood, adolescence and even adulthood, she says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tip 6: Spend your calories wisely.</strong><br />\r\nAll calories are not created equal. &ldquo;If your diet consists mainly of sugar, saturated/trans fats and salt &mdash; all of which can be very addictive &mdash; you can develop consistent cravings for dense, high-calorie foods with little nutritional value,&rdquo; says Julia Zumpano, RD, LD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This leads to excess calories and weight gain or inability to lose weight.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eat foods that are high in lean protein, healthy fats and fiber, and you&rsquo;ll feel satisfied throughout the day and will rarely get cravings. This will help you maintain a lower calorie level, which will lead to weight loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tip 7: Plan tomorrow&rsquo;s meals today.</strong><br />\r\nPlanning ahead stops that &ldquo;grab what you see&rdquo; panic that sets in when you wait to plan dinner until you&rsquo;re starving at 6 p.m. Scaring up dinner on the fly is likely to bring less nutritious, higher-calorie choices to your table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you sit down for dinner tonight, plan what you&rsquo;ll eat for dinner tomorrow. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so much easier to do when you&rsquo;re not hungry,&rdquo; says Andrea Dunn, RD, LD, CDE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This also gives you time to take something out of the freezer, chop veggies tonight to put in the crockpot tomorrw morning, and ask which family members will be home for dinner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://my.cleavelandclinic.org\" target=\"_blank\">Source: my cleaveland Clinic</a></p>\r\n', 'MealPrep-768x509.jpg', '', '2018-10-13', '', ''),

(27, '', '5062', 'Arthritis it\'s Symptoms, Causes, diagnosis and Treatment', '<p>It is an inflammation of one or more of your joints. The main symptoms of arthritis are joint pain and stiffness, which typically worsen with age. The most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Osteoarthritis causes cartilage &mdash; the hard, slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones where they form a joint &mdash; to break down. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that first targets the lining of joints (synovium).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uric acid crystals, infections or underlying disease, such as psoriasis or lupus, can cause other types of arthritis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatments vary depending on the type of arthritis. The main goals of arthritis treatments are to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Symptoms</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common signs and symptoms of arthritis involve the joints. Depending on the type of arthritis you have, your signs and symptoms may include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Pain</li>\r\n	<li>Stiffness</li>\r\n	<li>Swelling</li>\r\n	<li>Redness</li>\r\n	<li>Decreased range of motion</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Causes</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The two main types of arthritis &mdash; osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis &mdash; damage joints in different ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Osteoarthritis</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common type of arthritis, osteoarthritis involves wear-and-tear damage to your joint&#39;s cartilage &mdash; the hard, slick coating on the ends of bones. Enough damage can result in bone grinding directly on bone, which causes pain and restricted movement. This wear and tear can occur over many years, or it can be hastened by a joint injury or infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In rheumatoid arthritis, the body&#39;s immune system attacks the lining of the joint capsule, a tough membrane that encloses all the joint parts. This lining, known as the synovial membrane, becomes inflamed and swollen. The disease process can eventually destroy cartilage and bone within the joint.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Risk factors</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Risk factors for arthritis include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Family history.</strong>&nbsp;Some types of arthritis run in families, so you may be more likely to develop arthritis if your parents or siblings have the disorder. Your genes can make you more susceptible to environmental factors that may trigger arthritis.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Age.</strong>&nbsp;The risk of many types of arthritis &mdash; including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout &mdash; increases with age.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Your sex.</strong>&nbsp;Women are more likely than are men to develop rheumatoid arthritis, while most of the people who have gout, another type of arthritis, are men.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Previous joint injury.</strong>&nbsp;People who have injured a joint, perhaps while playing a sport, are more likely to eventually develop arthritis in that joint.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Obesity.</strong>&nbsp;Carrying excess pounds puts stress on joints, particularly your knees, hips and spine. Obese people have a higher risk of developing arthritis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Complications</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Severe arthritis, particularly if it affects your hands or arms, can make it difficult for you to do daily tasks. Arthritis of weight-bearing joints can keep you from walking comfortably or sitting up straight. In some cases, joints may become twisted and deformed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Diagnosis</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>During the physical exam, your doctor will check your joints for swelling, redness and warmth. He or she will also want to see how well you can move your joints. Depending on the type of arthritis suspected, your doctor may suggest some of the following tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Laboratory tests</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The analysis of different types of body fluids can help pinpoint the type of arthritis you may have. Fluids commonly analyzed include blood, urine and joint fluid. To obtain a sample of your joint fluid, your doctor will cleanse and numb the area before inserting a needle in your joint space to withdraw some fluid (aspiration).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Imaging</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>These types of tests can detect problems within your joint that may be causing your symptoms. Examples include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>X-rays.</strong>&nbsp;Using low levels of radiation to visualize bone, X-rays can show cartilage loss, bone damage and bone spurs. X-rays may not reveal early arthritic damage, but they are often used to track progression of the disease.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Computerized tomography (CT).</strong>&nbsp;CT scanners take X-rays from many different angles and combine the information to create cross-sectional views of internal structures. CTs can visualize both bone and the surrounding soft tissues.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</strong>&nbsp;Combining radio waves with a strong magnetic field, MRI can produce more-detailed cross-sectional images of soft tissues such as cartilage, tendons and ligaments.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Ultrasound.</strong>&nbsp;This technology uses high-frequency sound waves to image soft tissues, cartilage and fluid-containing structures such as bursae. Ultrasound also is used to guide needle placement for joint aspirations and injections.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"dis arthritis\" src=\"http://doctorsinservice.com/cms/editor/upload/imgs/curing art.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:173px; margin:2px; width:292px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arthritis treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and improving joint function. You may need to try several different treatments, or combinations of treatments, before you determine what works best for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Medications</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The medications used to treat arthritis vary depending on the type of arthritis. Commonly used arthritis medications include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Analgesics.</strong>&nbsp;These medications help reduce pain, but have no effect on inflammation. Examples include acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), tramadol (Ultram, Ultracet, others) and narcotics containing oxycodone (Percocet, Oxycontin, others) or hydrocodone (Norco, Vicoprofen, others).</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).</strong>&nbsp;NSAIDs reduce both pain and inflammation. Over-the-counter NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Some types of NSAIDs are available only by prescription. Oral NSAIDs can cause stomach irritation, and some may increase your risk of heart attack or stroke. Some NSAIDs are also available as creams or gels, which can be rubbed on joints.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Counterirritants.</strong>&nbsp;Some varieties of creams and ointments contain menthol or capsaicin, the ingredient that makes hot peppers spicy. Rubbing these preparations on the skin over your aching joint may interfere with the transmission of pain signals from the joint itself.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).</strong>&nbsp;Often used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, DMARDs slow or stop your immune system from attacking your joints. Examples include methotrexate (Trexall) and hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil).</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Biologic response modifiers.</strong>&nbsp;Typically used in conjunction with DMARDs, biologic response modifiers are genetically engineered drugs that target various protein molecules that are involved in the immune response. Examples include etanercept (Enbrel) and infliximab (Remicade).</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Corticosteroids.</strong>&nbsp;This class of drug, which includes prednisone and cortisone, reduces inflammation and suppresses the immune system. Corticosteroids can be taken orally or be injected directly into the painful joint.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Therapy</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Physical therapy can be helpful for some types of arthritis. Exercises can improve range of motion and strengthen the muscles surrounding joints. In some cases, splints or braces may be warranted.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Surgery</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If conservative measures don&#39;t help, your doctor may suggest surgery, such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Joint repair.</strong>&nbsp;In some instances, joint surfaces can be smoothed or realigned to reduce pain and improve function. These types of procedures can often be performed arthroscopically &mdash; through small incisions over the joint.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Joint replacement.</strong>&nbsp;This procedure removes your damaged joint and replaces it with an artificial one. Joints most commonly replaced are hips and knees.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Joint fusion.</strong>&nbsp;This procedure is more often used for smaller joints, such as those in the wrist, ankle and fingers. It removes the ends of the two bones in the joint and then locks those ends together until they heal into one rigid unit.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Lifestyle and home remedies</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In many cases, arthritis symptoms can be reduced with the following measures:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Weight loss.</strong>&nbsp;If you&#39;re obese, losing weight will reduce the stress on your weight-bearing joints. This may increase your mobility and limit future joint injury.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Exercise.</strong>&nbsp;Regular exercise can help keep your joints flexible. Swimming and water aerobics may be good choices because the buoyancy of the water reduces stress on weight-bearing joints.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Heat and cold.</strong>&nbsp;Heating pads or ice packs may help relieve arthritis pain.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Assistive devices.</strong>&nbsp;Using canes, walkers, raised toilet seats and other assistive devices can help protect your joints and improve your ability to perform daily tasks.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Alternative medicine</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people use alternative remedies for arthritis, but there is little reliable evidence to support the use of many of these products. The most promising alternative remedies for arthritis include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Acupuncture.</strong>&nbsp;This therapy uses fine needles inserted at specific points on the skin to reduce many types of pain, including that caused by some types of arthritis.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Glucosamine.</strong>&nbsp;Although study results have been mixed, it now appears that glucosamine works no better than placebo. However, glucosamine and the placebo both relieved arthritis pain better than taking nothing, particularly in people who have moderate to severe pain.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Yoga or tai chi.</strong>&nbsp;The slow, stretching movements associated with yoga and tai chi may help improve joint flexibility and range of motion in people with some types of arthritis.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Massage.</strong>&nbsp;Light stroking and kneading of muscles may increase blood flow and warm affected joints, temporarily relieving pain. Make sure your massage therapist knows which joints are affected by arthritis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Preparing for your appointment</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While you might first discuss your symptoms with your family doctor, he or she may refer you to a doctor who specializes in the treatment of joint problems (rheumatologist) for further evaluation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What you can do</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Before your appointment, make a list that includes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Detailed descriptions of your symptoms</li>\r\n	<li>Information about medical problems you&#39;ve had in the past</li>\r\n	<li>Information about the medical problems of your parents or siblings</li>\r\n	<li>All the medications and dietary supplements you take</li>\r\n	<li>Questions you want to ask the doctor</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What to expect from your doctor</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor may ask some of the following questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>When did your symptoms start?</li>\r\n	<li>Does activity make the pain better or worse?</li>\r\n	<li>What joints are painful?</li>\r\n	<li>Do you have a family history of joint pain?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://mayoclinic.org\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href, \'DISCLINIC-MAYOCLINIC\', \'resizable=yes,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=yes,scrollbars=yes,dependent=no\'); return false;\"><strong>source:mayoclinic</strong></a></p>\r\n', 'artwhat.jpg', '', '2018-10-16', '', '');

Fortunately, there are steps youâ€¯can take to help prevent thisâ€¯common disorder of the urinary tract.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"kidneypain\" src=\"http://doctorsinservice.com/cms/editor/upload/imgs/kidney-pain.jpg\" style=\"border-style:solid; border-width:2px; float:right; height:281px; margin:2px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To prevent kidney stones:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Drink plenty of water. Remember,â€¯dehydration&nbsp;is one of the primary causes of kidney stones. Onâ€¯warmer days, when it&rsquo;s easier to get dehydrated, up your fluid intake. Active people should drink at least 16- 20 ounces of fluid one to two hours before an outdoor activity. Overall, drink 60 &ndash; 64 ounces each day. Signs of dehydration include fatigue, loss of appetite, flushed skin, heat intolerance, light-headedness, dark-colored urine and dry cough.&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Limit sodium.â€¯This will cut down on the amount of calcium in your urine, which in turn reduces the tendency for calcium stones to form. Perhaps, you stop adding additional salt to yourâ€¯food. Another way to limit sodium is to avoid processed meats, salty convenience foods (regular, boxed or canned soups, noodle or rice mixes) and salty snacks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Eat more citrus. You want to consume foods rich in citrates, including oranges, melons, lemons and limes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Kidney stonesâ€¯are also more common in those with a family history, or those who have already had one.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Urologistâ€¯Manoj Monga, MD, FACS, treats patients with kidney stones, and he stresses the importance of proper hydration and a healthy diet.â€¯&ldquo;Limit foods that are high in protein, including meat, eggs and fish, as well as prepared and fast foods, which are often high in salt,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How can you tell if you&rsquo;re developing a kidney stone?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, there are few signs that a kidney stone is forming. Usually, youâ€¯don&rsquo;t know until the kidney stone starts to move. When this happens, a person typically experiences pain in their upper back that can move down to their lower abdomen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The good news is that when kidney stones are present, you have a variety of treatment options. A small stone can be present for years without any symptoms. And when discomfort begins to happen, there are medications that your doctor can prescribe to allow the stone to pass naturally.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How areâ€¯kidney stones treated?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For these medications to work, there must be an early diagnosis, Dr.â€¯Mongaâ€¯says. For larger stones, heâ€¯performs a variety of safe surgical procedures including:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Shock wave lithotripsyâ€¯&mdash; an outpatient procedure that uses sound waves to disintegrate kidney stones into smaller pieces that then pass on their own.&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Ureteroscopyâ€¯&mdash; an outpatient procedure in which a scope is inserted through the ureter (opening through which urine passes) and a laser is used to break up the stone(s); fragments are removed in a tiny basket, though some may pass through urine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Percutaneous nephrolithotomyâ€¯&mdash; an inpatient procedure that involves making a small (about one inch) incision in the back through which larger or less accessible stones are removed; patients are typically discharged within two days.&nbsp;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have symptoms of a kidney stone, talk to your doctor. There are many ways to find relief.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://my.cleavelandclinic.org\" target=\"_blank\">Source: Cleaveland Clinic</a></p>\r\n', 'kidneyst.jpg', '', '2018-10-17', '', '');

His love for work sometimes saw him not charging anything for such work. This also sometimes was fueled by his passion to see patients comfortable irrespective of whether he is paid or not. It was during one of such home care services that he landed a strategic property which later became the first home of Doctors in Service Limited. The company initially was to focus on home care services and discussions on those were held with a few people. However, the plan of God was different. We were to move into ambulatory clinics whose mission was to provide a fast, affordable client centered and quality healthcare for the numerous middle and upper class who often are frustrated by the slow, painful process of seeking medical attention in the public system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It started with staff strength of 8 persons and locum doctors with a lot of hard work, training and retraining of staff on excellent customer care, quality service and so on.

But having one or even several breast cancer risk factors doesn&#39;t necessarily mean you&#39;ll develop breast cancer. Many women who develop breast cancer have no known risk factors other than simply being women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FACTORS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF BREAST CANCER INCLUDE:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Being female</strong>. Women are much more likely than men are to develop breast cancer.</li>\r\n	<li>Increasing age. Your risk of breast cancer increases as you age.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>A personal history of breast conditions</strong>. If you&#39;ve had a breast biopsy that found lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) or atypical hyperplasia of the breast, you have an increased risk of breast cancer.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>A personal history of breast cancer</strong>. If you&#39;ve had breast cancer in one breast, you have an increased risk of developing cancer in the other breast.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>A family history of breast cancer</strong>. If your mother, sister or daughter was diagnosed with breast cancer, particularly at a young age, your risk of breast cancer is increased. Still, the majority of people diagnosed with breast cancer have no family history of the disease.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Inherited genes that increase cancer risk</strong>. Certain gene mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer can be passed from parents to children. The most well-known gene mutations are referred to as BRCA1 and BRCA2. These genes can greatly increase your risk of breast cancer and other cancers, but they don&#39;t make cancer inevitable.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Radiation exposure</strong>. If you received radiation treatments to your chest as a child or young adult, your risk of breast cancer is increased.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Obesity</strong>. Being obese increases your risk of breast cancer.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Beginning your period at a younger age</strong>. Beginning your period before age 12 increases your risk of breast cancer.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Beginning menopause at an older age</strong>. If you began menopause at an older age, you&#39;re more likely to develop breast cancer.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Having your first child at an older age</strong>. Women who give birth to their first child after age 30 may have an increased risk of breast cancer.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Having never been pregnant</strong>. Women who have never been pregnant have a greater risk of breast cancer than do women who have had one or more pregnancies.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Postmenopausal hormone therapy</strong>. Women who take hormone therapy medications that combine estrogen and progesterone to treat the signs and symptoms of menopause have an increased risk of breast cancer. The risk of breast cancer decreases when women stop taking these medications.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Drinking alcohol</strong>.

Try to:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ask your doctor about breast cancer screening</strong>. Discuss with your doctor when to begin breast cancer screening exams and tests, such as clinical breast exams and mammograms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks of screening</strong>. Together, you can decide what breast cancer screening strategies are right for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Become familiar with your breasts through breast self-exam for breast awareness</strong>. Women may choose to become familiar with their breasts by occasionally inspecting their breasts during <strong>a breast self-exam for breast awareness</strong>. If there is a new change, lumps or other unusual signs in your breasts, talk to your doctor promptly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breast awareness can&#39;t prevent breast cancer, but it may help you to better understand the normal changes that your breasts undergo and identify any unusual signs and symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Drink alcohol in moderation</strong>, if at all. Limit the amount of alcohol you drink to no more than one drink a day, if you choose to drink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Exercise most days of the week</strong>. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week. If you haven&#39;t been active lately, ask your doctor whether it&#39;s OK and start slowly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Limit postmenopausal hormone therapy</strong>. Combination hormone therapy may increase the risk of breast cancer. Talk with your doctor about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; Some women experience bothersome signs and symptoms during menopause and, for these &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;women, the increased risk of breast cancer may be acceptable in order to relieve menopause signs and symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; To reduce the risk of breast cancer, use the lowest dose of hormone therapy possible for the shortest amount of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Maintain a healthy weight</strong>. If your weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight. If you need to lose weight, ask your doctor about healthy strategies to accomplish this. Reduce the number of calories you eat each day and slowly increase the amount of exercise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Choose a healthy diet.</strong> Women who eat a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and mixed nuts may have a reduced risk of breast cancer. The Mediterranean diet focuses mostly on plant-based foods, such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts.

It produces images that can help detect any lumps or abnormalities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A suspicious result can be followed up by further diagnosis. However, mammography sometimes shows up a suspicious area that is not cancer. This can lead to unnecessary stress and sometimes interventions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An ultrasound scan</strong> can help differentiate between a solid mass or a fluid-filled cyst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An MRI scan involves</strong> injecting a dye into the patient, so find out how far the cancer has spread.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Biopsy</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A sample of tissue is surgically removed for laboratory analysis. This can show whether the cells are cancerous, and, if so, which type of cancer it is, including whether or not the cancer is hormone-sensitive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Diagnosis also involves staging the cancer, to establish:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>the size of a tumor</li>\r\n	<li>how far it has spread</li>\r\n	<li>whether it is invasive or non-invasive</li>\r\n	<li>whether it has metastasized, or spread to other parts of the body</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Staging will affect the chances of recovery and will help decide on the best treatment options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Breast cancer supportive therapy and survivorship</li>\r\n	<li>Breast cancer surgery</li>\r\n	<li>Chemotherapy for breast cancer</li>\r\n	<li>Radiation therapy for breast cancer</li>\r\n	<li>Recurrent breast cancer</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor determines your breast cancer treatment options based on your type of breast cancer, its stage and grade, size, and whether the cancer cells are sensitive to hormones. Your doctor also considers your overall health and your own preferences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most women undergo surgery for breast cancer and also receive additional treatment before or after surgery, such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy or radiation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many options for breast cancer treatment, and you may feel overwhelmed as you make complex decisions about your treatment. Consider seeking a second opinion from a breast specialist in a breast center or clinic. Talk to other women who have faced the same decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Breast cancer surgery</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Operations used to treat breast cancer include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Removing the breast cancer (lumpectomy).</strong> During a lumpectomy, which may be referred to as breast-conserving surgery or wide local excision, the surgeon removes the tumor and a small margin of surrounding healthy tissue.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A lumpectomy may be recommended for removing smaller tumors. Some people with larger tumors may undergo chemotherapy before surgery to shrink a tumor and make it possible to remove completely with a lumpectomy procedure.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Removing the entire breast (mastectomy).</strong> A mastectomy is an operation to remove all of your breast tissue. Most mastectomy procedures remove all of the breast tissue &mdash; the lobules, ducts, fatty tissue and some skin, including the nipple and areola (total or simple mastectomy). Newer surgical techniques may be an option in selected cases in order to improve the appearance of the breast. Skin-sparing mastectomy and nipple-sparing mastectomy are increasingly common operations for breast cancer.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Removing a limited number of lymph nodes (sentinel node biopsy</strong>). To determine whether cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, your surgeon will discuss with you the role of removing the lymph nodes that are the first to receive the lymph drainage from your tumor. If no cancer is found in those lymph nodes, the chance of finding cancer in any of the remaining lymph nodes is small and no other nodes need to be removed.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Removing several lymph nodes (axillary lymph node dissection).</strong> If cancer is found in the sentinel lymph nodes, your surgeon will discuss with you the role of removing additional lymph nodes in your armpit.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Removing both breasts</strong>. Some women with cancer in one breast may choose to have their other (healthy) breast removed (contralateral prophylactic mastectomy) if they have a very increased risk of cancer in the other breast because of a genetic predisposition or strong family history. Most women with breast cancer in one breast will never develop cancer in the other breast. Discuss your breast cancer risk with your doctor, along with the benefits and risks of this procedure.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Complications of breast cancer surgery depend on the procedures you choose. Breast cancer surgery carries a risk of pain, bleeding, infection and arm swelling (lymphedema).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may choose to have breast reconstruction after surgery. Discuss your options and preferences with your surgeon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider a referral to a plastic surgeon before your breast cancer surgery. Your options may include reconstruction with a breast implant (silicone or water) or reconstruction using your own tissue. These operations can be performed at the time of your mastectomy or at a later date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RADIATION THERAPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Radiation therapy uses high-powered beams of energy, such as X-rays and protons, to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy is typically done using a large machine that aims the energy beams at your body (external beam radiation). But radiation can also be done by placing radioactive material inside your body (brachytherapy).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>External beam radiation of the whole breast is commonly used after a lumpectomy. Breast brachytherapy may be an option after a lumpectomy if you have a low risk of cancer recurrence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Doctors may also recommend radiation therapy to the chest wall after a mastectomy for larger breast cancers or cancers that have spread to the lymph nodes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breast cancer radiation can last from three days to six weeks, depending on the treatment. A doctor who uses radiation to treat cancer (radiation oncologist) determines which treatment is best for you based on your situation, your cancer type and the location of your tumor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Side effects of radiation therapy include fatigue and a red, sunburn-like rash where the radiation is aimed. Breast tissue may also appear swollen or more firm. Rarely, more-serious problems may occur, such as damage to the heart or lungs or, very rarely, second cancers in the treated area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CHEMOTHERAPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chemotherapy uses drugs to destroy fast-growing cells, such as cancer cells. If your cancer has a high risk of returning or spreading to another part of your body, your doctor may recommend chemotherapy after surgery to decrease the chance that the cancer will recur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chemotherapy is sometimes given before surgery in women with larger breast tumors. The goal is to shrink a tumor to a size that makes it easier to remove with surgery. Chemotherapy is also used in women whose cancer has already spread to other parts of the body. Chemotherapy may be recommended to try to control the cancer and decrease any symptoms the cancer is causing. Chemotherapy side effects depend on the drugs you receive. Common side effects include hair loss, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and an increased risk of developing an infection. Rare side effects can include premature menopause, infertility (if premenopausal), damage to the heart and kidneys, nerve damage, and, very rarely, blood cell cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>HORMONE THERAPY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hormone therapy &mdash; perhaps more properly termed hormone-blocking therapy &mdash; is often used to treat breast cancers that are sensitive to hormones. Doctors sometimes refer to these cancers as estrogen receptor positive (ER positive) and progesterone receptor positive (PR positive) cancers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hormone therapy can be used before or after surgery or other treatments to decrease the chance of your cancer returning. If the cancer has already spread, hormone therapy may shrink and control it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREATMENTS THAT CAN BE USED IN HORMONE THERAPY INCLUDE</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Medications that block hormones from attaching to cancer cells (selective estrogen receptor modulators)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; Medications that stop the body from making estrogen after menopause (aromatase inhibitors)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Surgery or medications to stop hormone production in the ovaries</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hormone therapy side effects depend on your specific treatment, but may include hot flashes, night sweats and vaginal dryness. More serious side effects include a risk of bone thinning and blood clots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Targeted Therapy Drugs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Targeted drug treatments attack specific abnormalities within cancer cells. As an example, several targeted therapy drugs focus on a protein that some breast cancer cells overproduce called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The protein helps breast cancer cells grow and survive. By targeting cells that make too much HER2, the drugs can damage cancer cells while sparing healthy cells.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Targeted therapy drugs that focus on other abnormalities within cancer cells are available. And targeted therapy is an active area of cancer research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your cancer cells may be tested to see whether you might benefit from targeted therapy drugs. Some medications are used after surgery to reduce the risk that the cancer will return. Others are used in cases of advanced breast cancer to slow the growth of the tumor.</p>\r\n', '', '');
